# Terraform adoption and independent releases

This repository owns the VPC, six subnets, routing, production database and security groups, asset/thumbnail buckets, database secret metadata, and the Batch/ECR runtime. The assistant consumes the versioned SSM contract; no parent checkout or shared Terraform state access is needed.

## Status and boundaries

The configuration was derived from live AWS account `001879457662`, region `us-east-1`, on 2026-09-05. See [INVENTORY.md](INVENTORY.md). The adoption check reviewed 33 imports without effective remote-value changes or replacements. Terraform has **not** been applied, CI roles/buckets have **not** been created, and GitHub releases have **not** been run. All changes are intentionally uncommitted for owner review.

This is an adoption configuration for the existing account, not a fresh-account installer. Persistent resources have `prevent_destroy`; release tooling also rejects every deletion/replacement. Existing sizing, networking, authentication, retention, broad runtime IAM policies, and secret delivery are preserved. Tightening those settings is a separate reviewed change. Database migrations, pgvector/schema setup, users, downloaded assets, and model data are not Terraform resources.

## Local inspection and one-time bootstrap

Install Terraform **1.14.7**, AWS CLI v2, and Python 3.11+. The AWS provider is pinned to **6.23.0**, with signed hashes for Windows and Linux in the checked-in lock files. Commands below run from this repository root in PowerShell. Never commit state, plans, `.private`, or runtime variable files.

```powershell
$env:AWS_PROFILE = 'AdminUser'
aws sts get-caller-identity
python infra/tools/inventory.py --component extractor --profile AdminUser
python infra/tools/check_adoption.py
```

`inventory.py` only reads AWS; it updates reviewable import IDs and stores raw, potentially secret-bearing material under ignored `.private/`. `check_adoption.py` copies source into a private local backend, runs plan, and rejects effective resource changes. It does not import into remote state or apply anything. Lambda can show one sensitivity-only environment update on first import: before/after values are identical. The checker verifies this rather than hiding environment drift with `ignore_changes`.

The existing account-wide GitHub OIDC provider is referenced, not duplicated or owned by this stack. Bootstrap creates a dedicated encrypted/versioned bucket and separate build, plan, and apply roles. Only the apply role can write production state; neither CI role can access bootstrap state. The extractor additionally creates a scan role. Review before applying:

```powershell
terraform -chdir=infra/bootstrap init
terraform -chdir=infra/bootstrap plan "-out=bootstrap.tfplan"
terraform -chdir=infra/bootstrap show bootstrap.tfplan
# After reviewing:
terraform -chdir=infra/bootstrap apply bootstrap.tfplan
Copy-Item infra/bootstrap/backend.tf.example infra/bootstrap/backend.tf
terraform -chdir=infra/bootstrap init -migrate-state "-backend-config=backend.hcl"
```

Retain the bootstrap state backup until remote migration is verified. Include `infra/bootstrap/backend.tf` in a later commit after migration so subsequent checkouts initialize the remote backend. Do not rerun a local-bootstrap apply against an already bootstrapped account.

Configure GitHub environments `production` (and `production-scan` in the extractor) to allow **main only**. Add required reviewers if supported by your GitHub plan. Without reviewer support, the separate manually dispatched approval workflow is the approval gate. Only trusted maintainers should have write/workflow-dispatch access. Protect main and review workflow/IAM changes. OIDC role trust uses exact repository/main subjects for build/plan and the named environment for apply/scan. No AWS access keys belong in GitHub secrets.

## Import baseline before enabling releases

Create a fresh plan against the remote backend; do not apply a private local-backend plan to remote state. Pause manual console/script deployment while adopting.

```powershell
terraform -chdir=infra init "-backend-config=backend.hcl"
terraform -chdir=infra plan "-out=.private/adoption.tfplan"
terraform -chdir=infra show .private/adoption.tfplan
# After reviewing the import-only baseline:
terraform -chdir=infra apply .private/adoption.tfplan
terraform -chdir=infra plan
```

Import blocks are intentionally retained as adoption history. They do not reimport resources already in state. `image_uri = null` and the shared-contract flag defaulting to false exist for this first baseline only. **After the first ordinary release, do not plan without the release inputs:** doing so would restore the original image tag or remove the shared contract. Use the workflow or `release.py`, which resolves the current image and sets the contract flag.

Adopt and release the extractor first. Its first reviewed normal release publishes `/cg-production/prod/shared/v1` and pins the Batch image digest. Then adopt/release the assistant. The contract contains only identifiers: VPC/subnets/security groups, database host/port, bucket names, and secret ARN. It contains no passwords. The assistant reads it through SSM and merges database host/port and thumbnail bucket into its existing environment.

## Release, review, and rollback

1. Pull requests run Terraform validation and isolated release-guard tests without AWS credentials.
2. Relevant main-branch pushes run checks and build changed application code as `sha-<commit>`. Infrastructure-only changes resolve the current deployed image. Builds use Linux AMD64 with Lambda-compatible manifest flags. A 25 GB free-disk check fails with guidance to select a larger runner if needed.
3. The plan role saves the binary plan privately in S3 under `plans/<run-id>/<attempt>/`, with a checksum/commit manifest. Logs contain a resource/action summary, not sensitive plan values. Review the complete plan locally with `terraform show` after downloading it using authorized AWS credentials. Do not post plan JSON publicly.
4. Run **Approve production release** on main with the reviewed **plan run ID**. It verifies the successful source workflow, repository, event, branch, attempt, commit, checksum, and a 24-hour expiry. It checks out the plan commit and applies that exact saved plan. An expired plan or stale state requires a new plan and approval; apply never silently replans.
5. The workflow verifies Lambda/Batch control-plane status. Complete the runtime checks below before treating the release as accepted.

The approval workflow is always explicit, with an additional environment-review gate when configured. All release/approval runs share a per-repository concurrency group and native S3 state locking. Saved plan contents are sensitive even when variables are marked sensitive. S3 blocks public access and expires plan objects and noncurrent versions; production state versions have no expiry.

For rollback, dispatch the plan workflow with the retained `sha256:...` image digest, then review/approve the resulting plan. For an infra/configuration rollback, make a reviewed source revert and plan again. Current ECR lifecycle rules are preserved: new `sha-` tags are retained, so rollback images are not automatically removed. Add any future SHA-image cleanup policy separately, accounting for deployed digests.

The old direct deployment scripts are disabled to prevent competing ownership. Gradio's Hugging Face synchronization remains independent and unchanged.

## Runtime acceptance and operational limits

- Assistant: authenticate with an existing test user; run a chat/search query; verify read-only SQL enforcement, conversation persistence, signed thumbnail/source links, and the existing buffered response behavior. Verify failure responses do not expose credentials. The control-plane smoke check alone does not establish application health.
- Extractor: use small fixtures and an **isolated test database** for a container integration check before a large scan. Check metadata and thumbnail output. The production scan workflow is not this isolated integration test: it uses the production job's database secret.
- A normal extractor deployment never submits a scan. **Submit metadata scan** requires an explicit non-empty S3 prefix and exact job revision, uses the `production-scan` environment, and sets `OVERRIDE_EXISTING=false`. Concurrent/duplicate scan requests remain an operator responsibility; GitHub serialization covers submission, not job execution.
- Live Lambda has no VPC attachment while RDS is private. This is preserved during adoption and may prevent database access. Resolve connectivity in a separate reviewed change before claiming end-to-end success; do not make RDS public as part of import.
- Container builds and authenticated integration tests were not run locally because Docker is not running and a test-user/test-database setup was not supplied. GitHub runner sizing and OIDC permissions still require a first live release validation.
